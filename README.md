# Galactic skills

This is a space for depositing various helpful artifacts ([skills](https://claude.com/blog/skills), [commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#personal-commands), etc.) for various agentic things like Claude Code or Gemini Code Agent. 
The idea is that by iterating over this we will create a robust set of community curated "skills" that would ultimately create guardrails preventing LLMs from doing crazy :shit: and ensuring best practices. Should probably be called Intergalactic LLM-taming commision (ILT).

This was not written by Claude.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are structured instructions that help AI agents work effectively with Galaxy development. They provide:

- **Best practices** - The right way to build Galaxy tools, workflows, and content
- **Patterns** - Common solutions to common problems
- **Examples** - Concrete references to learn from
- **Guardrails** - Preventing common mistakes

> **Important**: This repo is for *developers* building Galaxy infrastructure. End-user analysis should happen in Galaxy itself to leverage its reproducibility and tracking features.

## Skills vs MCP

| Repository | Purpose | Use For |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **skills** (this repo) | *Knowledge* - How to build things well | Tool development, workflow conversion, content creation |
| [**galaxy-mcp**](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-mcp) | *Capabilities* - Interact with Galaxy programmatically | Testing, automation, CI/CD |

Use both together for best results.

## Installation & Usage

### Claude Code (Native Support)

Skills are automatically available. Just clone this repo into your workspace or add to `.claude/skills/`:

```bash
# Personal skills (available in all projects)
cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/skills galaxy

# Project skills (specific to one project)
cd your-project/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/skills galaxy
```

Claude will automatically discover and use skills when relevant.

### Windsurf / Cursor / Aider (via openskills)

```bash
# Install openskills
npm i -g openskills

# Install Galaxy skills
openskills install galaxyproject/skills

# Load a specific skill when needed
openskills read tool-updates
```

### Any Agent (Manual)

Clone this repo into your workspace and reference skills in your prompts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/skills
```

The LLM can read skill files directly from the workspace.

## Available Skills

### Tool Development

**tool-dev** ✅

Create and update Galaxy tool wrappers.

- Comprehensive SKILL.md covering tool creation, testing, IUC review, and updates
- **references/** - Standalone testing and tool placement guides (also used by other skills)
- **tool-selection-diagram/** - Generate "which tool?" flowchart PNGs for multi-tool suites

**udt-authoring** ✅

Author Galaxy User-Defined Tools (UDTs) — the `class: GalaxyUserTool` YAML format a non-admin user creates and runs (distinct from classic XML/ToolShed wrappers).

- SKILL.md with the authoring loop and offline/server validation tiers
- **references/** - UserToolSource schema, `$(...)` templating, common mistakes checklist
- **scripts/validate.py** - offline validate + lint via galaxy-tool-util
- **examples/** - seven complete UDTs, simple to complex

### Content

**hub-news-posts** ✅

Write news posts for the Galaxy Project website (galaxyproject.org).

- Frontmatter templates
- Image handling
- Vega charts
- Styled tables

### Conversion

**nf-to-galaxy** ✅

Convert Nextflow processes and workflows to Galaxy tools and workflows.

- Process → Tool XML
- Container → bioconda mapping
- Workflow → .ga files
- Test with planemo and galaxy-mcp

### Integration

**galaxy-integration** ✅

Interact with Galaxy instances via MCP, JupyterLite, or BioBlend.

- **jupyterlite/** - Write notebooks using gxy package
- **mcp-reference/** - Complete MCP tools reference
- Tool checking and workflow testing examples
- BioBlend automation scripts

### Server Tool Management

**update-usegalaxy-tool** ✅

Add or update ToolShed tool revisions in the [usegalaxy-tools](https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-tools) repository.

- Resolve changeset revisions via ToolShed API
- Edit `.yml` / `.yml.lock` toolset files
- Handle adds, updates, moves, and removals across sections
- Lint with `fix_lockfile.py`

### Collection Manipulation

**collection-manipulation** ✅

Transform Galaxy dataset collections reproducibly using native tools.

- Filter, sort, relabel, merge, flatten, nest collections
- 26 collection operation tools
- Apply Rules DSL for complex restructuring
- API patterns and pitfall avoidance
